### freertos, libopencm3, cherryusb hacking

just... attempting things...

Trying a nucleo f429zi board for starters, something I'm relatively familiar with.

```
pre rtos...
init hc low
[I/USB] ========== dwc2 hcd params ==========
[I/USB] GCCFG:00000000
[I/USB] CID:00000000
[I/USB] GSNPSID:00000000
[I/USB] GHWCFG1:00000000
[I/USB] GHWCFG2:00000000
[I/USB] GHWCFG3:00000000
[I/USB] GHWCFG4:00000000
[I/USB] dwc2 has 1 channels
[E/USB] This dwc2 version does not support dma, so stop working

```
