freertos blinking via a task and a timer, using libopencm3

When it's "working" you should see things like this:

(gdb) info threads
  Id   Target Id         Frame 
* 1    Thread 536873160 "" (Name: IDLE, State: Running) prvCheckTasksWaitingTermination ()
    at /home/karlp/src/FreeRTOSV8.2.3/FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c:3038
  2    Thread 536872312 "" (Name: green.blink) vPortYield ()
    at /home/karlp/src/FreeRTOSV8.2.3/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/port.c:376
  3    Thread 536873768 "" (Name: Tmr Svc) vPortYield ()
    at /home/karlp/src/FreeRTOSV8.2.3/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/port.c:376
(gdb)

and things like "run" should work as expected.

When it's not working, you get things like this: (and you'll notice bad things happening on the oocd -d3 console)

(gdb) c
Continuing.
^C
Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.

Tested openocd version: v0.10.0-523-g2a3b709a

Freertos 8.2.x:  Working both blinks and thread info
Freertos 9.0.0:  Working blinks, gdb broken as thread info corrupt
Freertos 10.0.1: Working blinks, gdb broken as thread info corrupt
Freertos 10.1.0: working blinks, fails to detect freertos.
Freertos 10.1.1: working blinks, detects, but broken operation, "Error: Error reading first thread item location in FreeRTOS thread list"
Freertos 10.2.1:  as 10.1.1, unless you have patch: http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/5273/1

For freertos 10.1.0, the failure to even detect freertos has been patched in freertos,
but even after manually applying, it remains broken.
